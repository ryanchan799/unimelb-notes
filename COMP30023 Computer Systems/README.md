Computer Systems
================
Here are the notes for Computer Systems, Sem 1 2018.

It's been pretty good so far. Lecturer speaks really fast and there's so much content.
Labs and workshops have been good at demonstrating how certain networking things work.

Hopefully it gets easier down the line! :muscle:
