3D has plenty of uses in natural user interfaces/multimedia

Subject will be focussed on _game dev_ since it's the most transferrable skill right now.

We will be using **Unity 2018.1.3 (Commnity)** for this subject.

Here's an example of **Good CG using unity**:
Not expecting us to make [CGBros level quality of graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa0S9JS3XVk) since we're _not artists_
- Notice how the artists used robots and masked humans so that they're easier to animate
- Hair/Faces are really hard to animate

Try not to be early access lol

Here's an example of **shitty CG**:
- [Mega Shark VS Giant Octopus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZDs1AR9qh8)
	- Expect a bit better graphics than this hopefully
- [Assassins Creed Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZDs1AR9qh8)

Will be spending a lot of time with graphics intensive work, so hopefully you have something with a nice GPU.
- Can borrow certain laptops and lab computers can at least run what we're doing.
