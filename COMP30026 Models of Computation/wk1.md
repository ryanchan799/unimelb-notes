


f -> g

any truth assignment for f that results in true results in true for g

if an assignment for g gives false then that same assignment for f has to give false

unsatisfiable is when no truth assignment gives true

(Q ∨ ¬P) ∧ P -> Q

(f -> g)
(¬f ∨ g)

opposite of this (f ∧ ¬g) must be satisfiable?????????
