Models of Computation COMP30026 Lecture 2
=========================================

- We use models to understand the world better
- This involves *abstraction*
- It's useful since we can *predict events*
- A good scientific model can help *explain what we see*

### Formal Languages
- Classify languages according to what sort of rules are allowed in describing how strings are generated
- We can consider a machine's ability to act as a recogniser for a language

### Introduction to Haskell
- Haskell is trippy
- Refer to [Declarative Notes](COMP30020)
