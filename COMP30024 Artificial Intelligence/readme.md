Artificial Intelligence Sem 1 2018
==================================

This was a pretty good course. You cover some more search algorithms like in Design/Foundations of Algorithms and make a game-playing AI. :ok_hand:

It touches on some other cool topics like Machine Learning in AI and some basic Probability. The main assignment is *similar* to Foundations of Computing where you compete against other players. There was a bunch of resources also provided by the tutors and lecturers like a online 1v1 arena to 'fight' your AIs which was really neat. :thumbsup:

However, in my semester the game was a *bit* broken (it was *really easy* to just cheese the game by staying in the middle of the board :no_mouth:) which sucked since a few marks came from your performance vs other players. Python was also not the best choice for this course since the bots were given computation time constraints that seemed a little too strict. Hopefully it's fixed when you do it!

*All in all, it's a pretty good course. I enjoyed it. Good Luck!*  :smile:
