Declarative Programming Sem 2 2017
==================================

This was a fun course. Definitely changes your perception of programming. 
I highly recommend taking it just for the Haskell section; it'll help you consider alternative ways to create a solution to a problem.
The course was one of the better coordinated courses and I recommend taking it before Models of Computation since that has a focus on Haskell.
