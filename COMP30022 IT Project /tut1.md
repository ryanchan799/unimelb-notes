IT Project Tutorial 1
=====================

We're going to be attempting to use *agile development* with *test-driven development* in this project.
### Project Description:
##### *Background*

##### *Users*

##### *Product*

##### *Definitions*

### Project Requirements:
##### *Features*
- User Stories
- Acceptance Criteria
- Paper Prototype
- Specifications
- Priority

### Agile Development Pipeline
- `Issues -> Backlog -> Working On -> Testing -> Ready to Go`
- Take issues from the backlog and start working on them
- These issues are *ordered by priority* and are taken

Consider using the MVC
- Model
- View
- Component

You should use jUnit and Mockito to run tests
- Use Mockito
	- Create fake external objects
	- Simulate object behaviour
	- Configure *expected interaction*
		- Use `when` to define a interaction
		- `any` keyword in jUnity
		- Use `verify` to test interactions
	- assertEquals
